# CATS Microbenchmark

These microbenchmarks are from https://bitbucket.org/delors/cats/src/master/, repackaged as Maven projects in order to enable easier builds since I couldn't get the framework they presented working :) No code changes have been made to the actual microbenchmark code, and all credit should go to the original authors. Please cite the following paper if you use this benchmark:
